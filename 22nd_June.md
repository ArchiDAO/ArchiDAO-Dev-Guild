* Hico presented an integrated approach to bring together AEC token as the ERC20, ArchiDAONFT as the NFT membership & skills NFT, a stablecoin and a a Protract-NFT that can be used for contracts. 
* A discussion and brainstorm ensued that looked at:
* Should stakeholders be allowed to participate not only with stake but also on the profits of a project?
* How to set up a project with stakeholders that use cryptoeconomics to reinforce good behaviour from both the DAO and the client?
* We need to develop variants of each option and find ways to test it.
* Protract NFT is a contract smart contract that is used as a project management system that automates the comission and (womanning of the system.
* What are the cryptoeconomics mechanisms to increase the value of the AEC token
* We can buy real estate and peg it to a real asset- we discussed on what the legal framework is so that we do not end up with an unworkable situation.


* decoupling governance from value?
